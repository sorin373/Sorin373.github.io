- Download the zip file from [sorin373.github.io](https://sorin373.github.io/)
- Extract the files on your desktop using [7-ZIP](https://www.7-zip.org/) / [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0)
- Open the folder entitled **Different Breed**
- Run the file **Different Breed.exe**. If a window pops up from the Windows antivirus (because the game is not officialy published and not a verified game the antivirus promps a warning) all you need to do is to click **More info** and then click **Run anyway**.
